              This is a recipe for the identity crisis that is Chicken Francese.
              <br />Myself and everyone I know like it with extra lemon in the
              sauce, and this recipe is a reflection of that.

              Cooking one or two roasts is easier, cheaper, more efficient, and
              sometimes just as delicious as cooking steaks for a large party!
              <br />This is a recipe for one such roast with a sauce that is to
              die for. The cut of beef is cheap and easy to find. And to top it
              all off, it eats well in any season of the year.<br />Enter, the
              London Broil (grilled).

              This is my favorite recipe to make Fettuccine (or any other pasta
              that is rolled out thinly). It is not all that much work, but it
              is as impressive as it is delicious. I make it for special
              occasions, to impress people, or to just have a darn good meal.
              This recipe is adapted from Helen Rennie's recipe.
