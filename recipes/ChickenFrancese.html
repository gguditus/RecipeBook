          This is a recipe for the identity crisis that is Chicken Francese. The
          dish is Italian-American in origin, but butchered French in name.
          Despite this, it is a favorite in the area surrounding its suspected
          site of origin, Rochester, New York. Myself and everyone I know like
          it with extra lemon in the sauce, and this recipe is a reflection of
          that.
          <br />Sick of chicken? Substitute veal (possibly the origin of this
          dish)! <br />Can't eat meat? Substitute butterflied shrimp, scallops,
          sole, or any white fish sliced thin!

        </li>
        <br />
        <li><b>Batter</b></li>
        <li>1/2 cup flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>3-4 eggs</li>
        <li>2 lemons zested and juiced</li>
        <br />
        <li><b>Sauce</b></li>
        <li>5 lemons juiced and 3 zested</li>
        <li>1 lemon sliced (optional)</li>
        <li>3-4 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 cups dry white wine</li>
        <li>4-5 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>2 tbsp flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="directions">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Cut or butterfly chicken breasts in half to make chicken cutlets,
            about 1/4 inch thick (if too thick, cover with saran wrap and pound
            with a flat mallet or heavy pan to flatten).
          </li>

          <li>
            Measure 1/2 cup of flour and add to a shallow pie dish, or a plate.
            Add salt, pepper, garlic powder, and zest of two lemons to the flour
            and mix. Beat 3-4 eggs in a second shallow pie dish or plate, then
            add the juice of two lemons and mix.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add oil to a large shallow pan and heat over medium heat and heat an
            oven to 350* F.
          </li>
          <li>
            Slice a clove of garlic and add it, the spinach, the 1 tsp of olive
            oil, 1 tbsp of chicken stock, and 1 tbsp of lemon juice to a pan and
            saute, or to a bowl and cook in a microwave.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dredge the chicken cutlets in the seasoned flour, dip the floured
            chicken into the egg mixture, and add straight to the heated pan.
          </li>
          <li>
            After about 2-3 minutes, flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes, or
            until both sides are golden-brown and crispy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, mince the cloves of garlic, then zest and juice the
            remaining lemons.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once all chicken is cooked, add it to a tray and bake at 350* F
            until the thickest pieces reach 150* F.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the same pan, melt the butter and add the minced garlic. Cook the
            garlic over medium heat until fragrant, about 1 minute*. Then add 2
            tbsp of flour slowly while mixing the butter to make a roux. Cook
            about another minute.
          </li>
          <p>
            *If you want, you can add some slices of lemon here to add even more
            lemon to the sauce and act as a nice garnish for the finished dish.
            Once seared, remove and reserve for later.
          </p>
          <li>
            Slowly add the dry white wine to the pan and allow the alcohol to
            cook off and reduce while scraping any browned bits in the bottom of
            the pan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next add the remaining lemon juice and lemon zest to the sauce.
            Finaly, add 3-4 cups of chicken broth until the sauce reaches your
            desired consistency. If you add too much, you can simply reduce by
            cooking the sauce a bit longer or adding a bit more butter (as long
            as your sauce does not break). If you reduce the sauce too much, you
            can add a bit of water to make the sauce more liquid.
          </li>
          <p>If desired, add the chicken back to the sauce (I recommend it).</p>
          <li>
            Finally, serve by plating spaghetti, then spinach, then chicken,
            optionally the sliced lemons here, and finally, smother with sauce!
          </li>
        </ol>
