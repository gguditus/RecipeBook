          This is a recipe for the identity crisis that is Chicken Francese. The
          dish is Italian-American in origin, but butchered French in name.
          Despite this, it is a favorite in the area surrounding its suspected
          site of origin, Rochester, New York. Myself and everyone I know like
          it with extra lemon in the sauce, and this recipe is a reflection of
          that.
          <br />Sick of chicken? Substitute veal (possibly the origin of this
          dish)! <br />Can't eat meat? Substitute butterflied shrimp, scallops,
          sole, or any white fish sliced thin!
