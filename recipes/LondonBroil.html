          Cooking and serving steaks for a large group of people is difficult
          and tiresome (not to mention it can get expensive). Grilling (or
          broiling) one or two large roast(s) for the same size group is easier,
          cheaper, more efficient, and sometimes just as delicious! <br />This
          is a recipe for one such roast with a sauce that is to die for. The
          cut of beef is cheap and easy to find. And to top it all off, it eats
          well in any season of the year. <br />Enter, the London Broil
          (grilled).

        <li>
          2-3 lbs top round roast (sometimes labeled “London Broil”) or flank
          steak
        </li>
        <li>
          1 cup beef stock (low sodium preferred; can sub water, but use half of
          a cup)
        </li>
        <li>2 tbsp brown sugar</li>

            In a medium bowl add all ingredients, leaving the roast and oil
            last. Mix well and taste for salt and black pepper. Add them as
            necessary, but the marinade should have nearly enough salt from the

          </li>
          <li>Next while mixing the marinade, slowly pour the olive oil in.</li>
          <li>
            Dry the roast of any liquid from packaging. Tenderize with a needle
            tenderizer, or poke with a thin knife in many spots, or lightly use
            a mallet tenderizer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the roast to a container, ziplock freezer bag, or a vacuum
            sealed bag. Add the marinade to the container or bag after mixing
            again.

          <li>Remove roast from marinade, and reserve the marinade.</li>
          <li>
            Place the roast on a medium-high heat grill. Alternatively if you
            want to keep with the name, place the roast on a sheet pan and into
            an oven set to broil ensuring at least 3 inches between the top of
            the roast and the heat source.
          </li>
          <li>
            Broil the roast for 10-15 minutes in the oven before flipping (aim
            for some good browning on each side) and broiling for another 10-15
            minutes (or until the internal temperature hits 130* f). On the
            grill, cook each side for about 4-6+ minutes depending on thickness
            and browning (or until the internal temperature hits 130* f). You
            can flip the rost(s) a couple of times here or reposition on each
            side to get attractive grill marks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, pour marinade into a small pot or saucepan or saucier and
            bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and allow the liquid to
            reduce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the liquid is about 2/3rds of its original volume, add butter

            Finally, slowly pour the marinade reduction into the roux to create
            a gravy-like sauce. Add salt and/or freshly ground black pepper as
            necessary.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the roast hits an internal temperature of 130* f in either
            method, remove from heat and allow to rest. The meat will continue
            to cook slightly, a solid medium doneness is likely the end result
            which will satisfy medium rare lovers and well done crazies alike
            (as long as they are a bit open minded). With a tough cut like this,
            that is a good target to hit.
          </li>
          <li>
            Slice no more than 1/4 inch thick <b>AGAINST</b> the grain (as with
            any meat, but especially with a particularly tough cut such as
            this). If the roast is too long to handily slice in one piece, cut
            the roast in half or thirds with the grain so you can then cut
            against the grain on the smaller halves or thirds.
          </li>
